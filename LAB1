TASK:
Use the touch command to create sets of empty practice files to use during this lab. In each set, replace X with the numbers 1 through 6. 
Create six files with names of the form songX.mp3, snapX.jpg, filmX.avi. Create three subdirectories for organizing your files, and name the
subdirectories friends, family, and work. Use a single command to create all three subdirectories at the same time.

CODE:
touch song{1..6}.mp3 snap{1..6}.jpg film{1..6}.avi

mkdir -p song_files snap_files film_files

mv song*.mp3 song_files/
mv snap*.jpg snap_files/
mv film*.avi film_files/
