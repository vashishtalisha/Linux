Permission Management:

Create the /home/consultants directory.

Add write permission to the consultants group. Use the symbolic method for setting the appropriate permissions.

Forbid others from accessing files in the /home/consultants directory. Use the octal method for setting the appropriate permissions.

mkdir home
mkdir home/consultants

chmod g+w home/consultants
ls -l

chmod 770 home/consultants
ls -l

  Change the default umask for the operator1 user. The new umask prohibits all access for users that are not in their group. Confirm that the umask is changed.
